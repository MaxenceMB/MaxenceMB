## Big projects  

> ### MaxenceMB/project-2d
> Top down platformer we make with a friend as a side-school project. Our goal is to make the codes only ourselves, with our knowledge and documentations. No copy-and-paste allowed, the goal is to learn.
> The game is basically a topdown exploration game like old zeldas: inventory, combat, quests or skill tree systems are what makes the game what it is. We focus on implementing fonctional systems before having great graphics.
> For us, the main focus is to gain experience by having a project we can work on and learn with.

> ### MaxenceMB/chickens-are-dinosaurs
> Sidescroll platformer we make with my girlfriend as a side project. The main goal here to learn how to work in team and develop our knowledges and skills. It's a chill project, we're making what we want to do; who wouldn't enjoy a common project with their partner!

# ðŸ‘‹ Yoo, Iâ€™m @MaxenceMB

## Current projects  

> ### MaxenceMB/life-completion
> A simple personnal app made in Java.
> In the app, you can add "achievements" to your life and keep track of them. The goal is to force myself keeping my new year's resolutions by making it look like I have to perfect a Steam game.  
> Also, there is a page where you can add a message once per week where you tell the best thing that happened this week. Next year, get a full report of everything that happened the best during the year.  
> This is a personnal project.

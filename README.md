# ðŸ‘‹ Yoo, Iâ€™m @MaxenceMB
- I'm a Computer Science student from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
- I love coding, art and video-games which makes me wanna combine the first two to make my own third.

  
## Current projects  

> ### MaxenceMB/website-portfolio
> My Portfolio website.  
> A website where all informations about me (my life, works, contacts...) are grouped in the same place.  
> The website is made in HTML, pure CSS and JavaScript. Also, I host the website myself on my Debian 12 VPS forcing me to use Unix shell commands few times a week.  
> This is a personnal project.
>
> Github repository: [MaxenceMB/website-portfolio](https://github.com/MaxenceMB/website-portfolio) 

> ### MaxenceMB/life-completion
> A simple personnal app made in Java.  
> In the app, you can add "achievements" to your life and keep track of them. The goal is to force myself keeping my new year's resolutions by making it look like I have to perfect a Steam game.  
> Also, there is a page where you can add a message once per week where you tell the best thing that happened this week. Next year, get a full report of everything that happened the best during the year.  
> This is a personnal project.
